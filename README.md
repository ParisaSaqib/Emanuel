Users are advised to use this information responsibly and within the boundaries of applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards.

## Objective


Our project aimed to simulate a sophisticated cyber attack scenario where an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link from a phishing email, leading to the download of a disguised PowerShell script. This script facilitated unauthorized remote access to the Domain Controller (DC) and DNS server, enabling the attacker to gather sensitive information from the maintenance workstation and forcibly change user credentials. Furthermore, the attack extended to modifying the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code, causing the water tank to overflow, demonstrating potential physical harm resulting from cyber vulnerabilities.

### Skills Learned

- Configuration and rules management using pfSense for firewall and router security.
- Management of servers including Domain Controller (DC), DNS server, and maintenance server, with emphasis on remote administration and maintenance.
- Utilization of obfuscation techniques to disguise malicious code and enhance cybersecurity defenses.
- Proficiency in modifying Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code for industrial automation and control systems.
- Implementation of networking solutions, including VLANs, subnets, and routing, to optimize network performance and security.
- Hands-on experience using various tools to simulate cyber attacks, enhancing understanding of attack vectors and defense strategies.
- Familiarity with cybersecurity best practices and methodologies in assessing and securing network infrastructure.
